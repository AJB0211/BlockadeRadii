## Blockade Radii Calculations

This is a small code sample to calculate a convolution integral using Monte-Carlo integration in C++. It utilizes `gauss_2d_sphere.h` from the NumericalRecipes library. The results are verified using by comparizon of the 1D numerical solution to the 1D analytical solution before moving to 2D. 

This code is largely without annotation or further explanation as it was intended for investigation in preceding aparatus design for a physics experiment.
